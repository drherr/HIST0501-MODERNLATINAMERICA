### Why use GitHub?  
As an academic and professional in an increasingly digital world it is important to consider our online presence. For students and faculty alike engaging and traversing a variety of digital environments is a powerful professional skill. The open access nature of GitHub and the powerful version-control of Git has placed GitHub among the most used as well as most useful tools of today's tech. developers. By asking our students to create GitHub profiles and contribute to content on this platform we are placing students in an environment where the opportunities for personal knowledge development are truly extensible. For this course we are committed to having students engage with some of the social/collaborative components of GitHub's interface ([the Repo. Wiki](https://github.com/drherr/HIST0501-MODERNLATINAMERICA/wiki) and [Issues Board](https://github.com/drherr/HIST0501-MODERNLATINAMERICA/issues)) with the hope that students will engage with other possible uses of GitHub and Git outside of what falls within this course's requirements.
